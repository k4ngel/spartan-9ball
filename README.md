# spartan-9ball

The goal of this project was to make a 9-ball-like game in VHDL. It was tested using Spartan 3E board, PS/2 mouse and a monitor connected via VGA. The project was made in Xilinx ISE and used third-party modules: PS/2 driver and VGA handler.

Though we didn't manage to finish the game throughout the semester, there are some working aspects of it that might be used sometime in the future. This repository conists of these files:
* README.md – this file,
* ucf.ucf – port mapping file,
* test.vhdl – sample simple test bench,
* obraz.vhdl – the main file,
* VGAster.vhdl – module for VGA handling,
* scheme.png - graphical scheme of connections between modules.
